This code was based on https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar . 

## Reproducing CNNs experiments

If you want to obtain CNN experiments accuracies and loss from the paper, simply run:

```
cd cnn
sh script.sh
```

The __double__ precision experiments require a Tesla or Volta GPUs for handling this numerical precision at a reasonable speed...

## Reproducing shallow experiments

All the codes necessary to reproduce the results from the paper as located in `shallow-nn`
